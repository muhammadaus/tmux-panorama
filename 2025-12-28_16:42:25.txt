⏺ Tmux Panorama Mode - Current Status Summary

  What Panorama Mode Does

  Creates two side-by-side panes sharing a single PTY. The PTY is sized to combined height (48 rows for two 24-row panes), allowing you to see more terminal output at once:
  - Left pane (master): shows rows 0-23 of the PTY
  - Right pane (slave): shows rows 24-47 of the PTY

  | cmd-split-window.c:136-191    | -W flag triggers panorama mode                                                   |

  Fixes Applied Today

  1. Added layout_make_leaf() and layout_fix_panes() to properly integrate slave into layout system
  2. Added window_pane_default_cursor() for slave pane initialization

  Known Limitations

  - capture-pane returns empty for slave (doesn't use panorama rendering logic)
  - Some unused variable warnings in build

  Instructions to Verify Visually

  # 1. Navigate to the tmux-panorama directory
  cd /Users/muhammadaushijri/Desktop/git/tmux-panorama

  # 2. Start tmux with the custom binary (use a separate socket to avoid conflicts)
  ./tmux -S /tmp/panorama.sock new-session

  # 3. Once inside tmux, create a panorama split:
  #    Press: Ctrl-b :
  #    Type:  split-window -W
  #    Press: Enter

  # 4. You should now see two side-by-side panes
  #    Run a command that produces lots of output:
  seq 1 100

  # 5. Expected behavior:
  #    - Left pane shows lines 1-24 (or similar range)
  #    - Right pane shows lines 25-48 (the next 24 lines)
  #    - Both panes scroll together as more output appears
  #    - Typing in either pane sends input to the same shell

  # 6. To exit:
  exit
  # Or: Ctrl-b : kill-server

  What Success Looks Like

  - Two panes side-by-side with same height
  - Running seq 1 100 shows different row ranges in each pane
  - The right pane shows content that continues from where the left pane ends
  - Keyboard input works from either pane
